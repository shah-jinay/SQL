--2. OUTER JOIN: 

--1) LEFT OUTER JOIN: return all the records from the left table and matching records from the right table, if we can not find any
                --matching records, then for that row we will return null. 

--list all customers whether they have made any purchase or not

SELECT c.ContactName, o.OrderDate

--customers who never placed any order

WHERE o.OrderDate IS NULL


--2) RIGHT OUTER JOIN: return all the records from the right table and matching records from the left table, if we can not find any
                --matching records, then for that row we will return null. 

--list all customers whether they have made any purchase or not

SELECT c.ContactName, o.OrderDate
FROM Orders o RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID


--3) FULL OUTER JOIN: returns all the rows from both left and right table even if we can't find the matching values. 


--Match all customers and suppliers by country.

SELECT c.ContactName As CustomerName, s.ContactName As SupplierName, c.Country As CustomerCountry, s.Country As SupplierCountry

--table 2 --> 20 rows
-- cross join table 1 and table 2 --> 200 rows 

SELECT * FROM Customers

SELECT * FROM Orders

SELECT *
FROM Customers CROSS JOIN Orders 


--* SELF JOINï¼ša table joins with itself.
